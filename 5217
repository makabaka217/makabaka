do you know what i mean?
i do need a fame, a fortune and a girl of me
i do want to go, to try, to cope with the warm spring
i will work hard, to meet myself,to meet my girl--in a nice condition with good things around
but now
makabaka
what you should do to exchange?
what is the price?
do you really understand?
 i am poor
i am slovenly
i talk around to prove a thing--i am alive, i am a human and i am someone
you can tell me that i am lonely
i tried hard,though failed
i try to seek company
but
makabaka
you
losed
and
failed
the most important one
it's
yourself
noman knows you better than yourself
don't let yourself down
